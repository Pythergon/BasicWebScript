Crappy ahhhhh programmer
Cry when you read his code

Perfected Jump Branch Details!
The Jump mechanic displeases me because you can change your direction (X-Vel) midair
We can fix this by detecting when the player is midair and locking the X-Vel until landing
I'm going to fix this by assigning a new variable called the playerJumpXVelocity

Did I use AI for the platform detection???
HELL YEAH OH MY GEEZ IF I HAD TO TYPE BASICALLY THE SAME LINES OF CODE TWENTY TIMES OVER ID QUIT MAN
