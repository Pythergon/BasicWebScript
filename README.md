Hey I made this project because I want to inspire my little brother to learn programming!
I'm not a very good programmer so I'd seriously apreciate all feedback on how to make my code run better or to improve it's readabiltiy.

What is this project? :
This project is just a game I'm designing along the way. 
Right now its just a square with jumping and moving physics.
